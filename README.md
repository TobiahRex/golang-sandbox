# T.Rex's Golang Sandbox

This is a collection of Golang code snippets that I've written to learn the language.
My foundational language is JS, then Python so I'll be comparing Golang to those languages,
or at least trying to understand the differences.

Given some topic, I'll try to explore the common expressed patterns in Golang.
I find this method to be the easiest & most effective way to learn a new language.
